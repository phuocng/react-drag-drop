# React drag-drop

Modern web applications offer a useful feature that allows users to drag and drop elements around the page. This creates a more intuitive and user-friendly experience, and it's become increasingly popular in recent years. In fact, drag and drop functionality has become so common that it's hard to imagine a modern web application without it. From social media platforms to e-commerce websites, drag and drop has become a staple of the user experience.

The reason for its popularity is simple: drag and drop is a powerful tool that can simplify complex tasks and make the user's life easier. You can find drag and drop functionality in a variety of real-world applications. For example, when using a file manager on your computer, you can drag files from one folder to another or onto an external drive. In video editing software, you can drag and drop clips onto a timeline to create a sequence. And in graphic design applications, you can drag and drop images and text boxes to create layouts.

On the web, drag and drop functionality can be used for a variety of purposes, such as moving items around in a to-do list or task manager, rearranging playlists or albums in music streaming services, or sorting products into a shopping cart or wishlist on e-commerce websites.

Implementing drag and drop functionality may require some additional coding compared to simple form inputs, but the benefits are well worth it.
